# Centrifuge: Narrative Pattern Editor and Profiler Tool

This is a cross-platform desktop tool for edditing narrative patterns and obtaining pattern metrics from a playtrace of Talk of the Town.

This version was built specifically for use with the [Talk of the Town](https://github.com/ShiJbey/talktown) simulationist story generator, made popular by the augmented reality live-acting game, [Bad News](https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~jor/publications/samuelBadNews.pdf). Here is an example [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUnp44OkaQo) of gameplay.

Normally in Bad News, one player acts as the _Wizard_ and must live-code inside a Python interpreter to find interestin dramatic content and surface it to the live-acting player. This process is tedious and requires knowledge of python programming and the internal simulation API. This application alleviates the live coding requirement by allowing players to define reusable narrative patterns using a visual node-based interface. Patterns can be used during or outside of gameplay to inspect simulation states. As an additional bonus, Centrifuge also allows users to visualize pattern metrics so that they may better characterize the simulation and its configuration.
